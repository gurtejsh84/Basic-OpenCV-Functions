# Real-Time Color Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a real-time color detection system using OpenCV and a webcam. The system allows users to adjust HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) ranges through trackbars to detect and mask specific colors in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time color detection using HSV color space
- Adjustable HSV ranges with trackbars
- Visualization of the original, masked, and result images side by side

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-color-detection.git
    cd real-time-color-detection
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python numpy
    ```

## Usage

Run the following command to start the real-time color detection:
```sh
python color_detection.py
